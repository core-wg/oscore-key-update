                     Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS)
                draft-ietf-core-oscore-key-update-latest

Abstract

   This document defines Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS), a lightweight
   procedure that two CoAP endpoints can use to update their keying
   material by establishing a new OSCORE Security Context.  Accordingly,
   it updates the use of the OSCORE flag bits in the CoAP OSCORE Option
   as well as the protection of CoAP response messages with OSCORE, and
   it deprecates the key update procedure specified in Appendix B.2 of
   RFC 8613.  Thus, this document updates RFC 8613.  Also, this document
   defines a procedure that two endpoints can use to update their OSCORE
   identifiers, run either stand-alone or during a KUDOS execution.

1.  Introduction

   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   [RFC8613] provides end-to-end protection of CoAP [RFC7252] messages
   at the application-layer, ensuring message confidentiality and
   integrity, replay protection, as well as binding of response to
   request between a sender and a recipient.

   To ensure secure communication when using OSCORE, peers may need to
   update their shared keying material.  Among other reasons,
   approaching key usage limits
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-aead-limits][I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-limits] requires
   updating the OSCORE keying material before communications can
   securely continue.

   This document updates [RFC8613] as follows.

   *  It specifies KUDOS, a lightweight key update procedure that the
      two peers can use in order to update their current keying material
      and establish a new OSCORE Security Context.  This deprecates and
      replaces the procedure specified in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613].

   *  With reference to the "OSCORE Flag Bits" registry defined in
      Section 13.7 of [RFC8613] as part of the "Constrained RESTful
      Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group, it updates the
      entries with Bit Position 0 and 1 (see Section 6), both originally
      marked as "Reserved".  That is, it defines and registers the usage
      of the OSCORE flag bit with Bit Position 0, as the one intended to
      expand the space for the OSCORE flag bits in the OSCORE Option
      (see Section 4.1).  Also, it marks the bit with Bit Position of 1
      as "Unassigned".

   *  It updates the protection of CoAP responses with OSCORE originally
      specified in Section 8.3 of [RFC8613], as defined in Section 3 of
      this document.

   Furthermore, this document specifies a method that two peers can use
   to update their OSCORE identifiers.  This can be run as a stand-alone
   procedure, or instead integrated in a KUDOS execution.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CoAP [RFC7252], Observe [RFC7641], CBOR [RFC8949], OSCORE
   [RFC8613], and EDHOC [RFC9528].

   This document additionally defines the following terminology.

   *  FS mode: the KUDOS execution mode that achieves forward secrecy
      (see Section 4.3).

   *  No-FS mode: the KUDOS execution mode that does not achieve forward
      secrecy (see Section 4.4).

   *  Equilibrium: KUDOS is in an idle state where no execution of KUDOS
      is currently ongoing.

2.  Current Methods for Rekeying OSCORE

   Two peers communicating using OSCORE may choose to renew their shared
   keying information by establishing a new OSCORE Security Context for
   a variety of reasons.  A particular reason is approaching limits set
   for safe key usage [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-limits].  Practically,
   when the relevant limits have been reached for an OSCORE Security
   Context, the two peers have to establish a new OSCORE Security
   Context, in order to continue using OSCORE for secure communication.
   That is, the two peers have to establish new Sender and Recipient
   Keys, as the keys actually used by the AEAD algorithm.

   In addition to approaching the key usage limits, there may be other
   reasons for a peer to initiate a key update procedure.  These
   include: the OSCORE Security Context approaching its expiration time;
   application policies prescribing a regular key rollover; approaching
   the exhaustion of the Sender Sequence Number space in the OSCORE
   Sender Context.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the peer initiating the key update procedure
   starts it with some margin, i.e., well before actually experiencing
   the trigger event forcing to perform a key update, e.g., the OSCORE
   Security Context expiration or the exhaustion of the Sender Sequence
   Number space.  If the rekeying is not initiated ahead of these
   events, it may become practically impossible to perform a key update
   with certain methods, and/or without aborting ongoing message
   exchanges.

   Other specifications define a number of ways for rekeying OSCORE, as
   summarized below.

   *  The two peers can run the procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of
      [RFC8613].  That is, the two peers exchange three or four
      messages, protected with temporary Security Contexts adding
      randomness to the ID Context.

      As a result, the two peers establish a new OSCORE Security Context
      with new ID Context, Sender Key, and Recipient Key, while keeping
      the same OSCORE Master Secret and OSCORE Master Salt from the old
      OSCORE Security Context.

      This procedure does not require any additional components to what
      OSCORE already provides, and it does not provide forward secrecy.

      The procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613] is used in
      6TiSCH networks [RFC7554][RFC8180] when handling failure events.
      That is, a node acting as Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) assists
      new devices, namely "pledges", to securely join the network as per
      the Constrained Join Protocol [RFC9031].  In particular, a pledge
      exchanges OSCORE-protected messages with the JRC, from which it
      obtains a short identifier, link-layer keying material and other
      configuration parameters.  As per Section 8.3.3 of [RFC9031], a
      JRC that experiences a failure event may likely lose information
      about joined nodes, including their assigned identifiers.  Then,
      the reinitialized JRC can establish a new OSCORE Security Context
      with each pledge, through the procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of
      [RFC8613].

   *  The two peers can run the OSCORE profile [RFC9203] of the
      Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
      (ACE) Framework [RFC9200].

      When a CoAP client uploads an Access Token to a CoAP server as an
      access credential, the two peers also exchange two nonces.  Then,
      the two peers use the two nonces together with information
      provided by the ACE Authorization Server that issued the Access
      Token, in order to derive an OSCORE Security Context.

      This procedure does not provide forward secrecy.

   *  The two peers can run the EDHOC key exchange protocol based on
      Diffie-Hellman and defined in [RFC9528], in order to establish a
      pseudo-random key in a mutually authenticated way.

      Then, the two peers can use the established pseudo-random key to
      derive external application keys.  This allows the two peers to
      securely derive an OSCORE Master Secret and an OSCORE Master Salt,
      from which an OSCORE Security Context can be established.

      This procedure additionally provides forward secrecy.

      EDHOC also specifies an optional function, EDHOC_KeyUpdate, to
      perform a key update in a more efficient way than re-running
      EDHOC.  The two communicating peers call EDHOC_KeyUpdate with
      equivalent input, which results in derivation of a new shared
      pseudo-random key.  Usage of EDHOC_KeyUpdate preserves forward
      secrecy.

      Note that EDHOC may be run standalone or as part of other
      workflows, such as when using the EDHOC and OSCORE profile of ACE
      [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   *  If one peer is acting as LwM2M Client and the other peer as LwM2M
      Server, according to the OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Core
      specification [LwM2M], then the LwM2M Client peer may take the
      initiative to bootstrap again with the LwM2M Bootstrap Server, and
      receive again an OSCORE Security Context.  Alternatively, the
      LwM2M Server can instruct the LwM2M Client to initiate this
      procedure.

      If the OSCORE Security Context information on the LwM2M Bootstrap
      Server has been updated, the LwM2M Client will thus receive a
      fresh OSCORE Security Context to use with the LwM2M Server.

      In addition to that, the LwM2M Client, the LwM2M Server as well as
      the LwM2M Bootstrap server are required to use the procedure
      defined in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613] and overviewed above, when
      they use a certain OSCORE Security Context for the first time
      [LwM2M-Transport].

   Manually updating the OSCORE Security Context at the two peers should
   be a last resort option, and it might often be not practical or
   feasible.

   Even when any of the alternatives mentioned above is available, it is
   RECOMMENDED that two OSCORE peers update their Security Context by
   using the KUDOS procedure as defined in Section 4 of this document.

3.  Updated Protection of Responses with OSCORE

   The protection of CoAP responses with OSCORE is updated, by adding
   the following text at the end of step 3 of Section 8.3 of [RFC8613].

   |  If the server is using a different Security Context for the
   |  response compared to what was used to verify the request (e.g.,
   |  due to an occurred key update), then the server MUST take the
   |  second alternative.  That is, the server MUST include its Sender
   |  Sequence Number as Partial IV in the response and use it to build
   |  the AEAD nonce to protect the response.
   |  
   |  This prevents the server from using the same AEAD (key, nonce)
   |  pair for two responses, protected with different OSCORE Security
   |  Contexts.
   |  
   |  An exception is the procedure in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613], which
   |  is secure although not complying with the above.  The reason is
   |  that, in that procedure, the server uses the new OSCORE Security
   |  Context only and solely to protect the outgoing response (response
   |  #1), and no other message is protected with that OSCORE Security
   |  Context.  Other procedures where that holds would also remain
   |  secure.

4.  Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS)

   This section defines KUDOS, a lightweight procedure that two OSCORE
   peers can use to update their keying material and establish a new
   OSCORE Security Context.

   KUDOS relies on the OSCORE Option defined in [RFC8613] and extended
   as defined in Section 4.1, as well as on the support function
   updateCtx() defined in Section 4.2.

   In order to run KUDOS, two peers perform a message exchange of
   OSCORE-protected CoAP messages.  This message exchange between the
   two peers is defined in Section 4.3, with particular reference to the
   stateful FS mode providing forward secrecy.  Building on the same
   message exchange, the possible use of the stateless no-FS mode is
   defined in Section 4.4, as intended to peers that are not able to
   write in non-volatile memory.  Two peers MUST run KUDOS in FS mode if
   they are both capable to.

   The key update procedure has the following properties.

   *  KUDOS can be initiated by either peer.  In particular, the CoAP
      client or the CoAP server may start KUDOS by sending a rekeying
      message.

   *  The new OSCORE Security Context enjoys forward secrecy, unless
      KUDOS is run in no-FS mode (see Section 4.4).

   *  The same ID Context value used in the old OSCORE Security Context
      is preserved in the new Security Context.  Furthermore, the ID
      Context value never changes throughout the KUDOS execution.

   *  KUDOS is robust against a peer rebooting, and it especially avoids
      the reuse of AEAD (nonce, key) pairs.

   *  KUDOS completes in one round trip by exchanging two CoAP messages.
      The two peers achieve mutual key confirmation in a following
      exchange, which is protected with the newly established OSCORE
      Security Context.

4.1.  Extensions to the OSCORE Option

   In order to support the message exchange for establishing a new
   OSCORE Security Context, this document extends the use of the OSCORE
   Option originally defined in [RFC8613] as follows.

   *  This document defines the usage of the eight least significant
      bit, called "Extension-1 Flag", in the first byte of the OSCORE
      Option containing the OSCORE flag bits.  The registration of this
      flag bit in the "OSCORE Flag Bits" registry is specified in
      Section 6.1.

      When the Extension-1 Flag is set to 1, the second byte of the
      OSCORE Option MUST include the OSCORE flag bits 8-15.

   *  This document defines the usage of the least significant bit
      "Nonce Flag", 'd', in the second byte of the OSCORE Option
      containing the OSCORE flag bits 8-15.  This flag bit is specified
      in Section 6.1.

      When it is set to 1, the compressed COSE object contains a field
      'x' and a field 'nonce', to be used for the steps defined in
      Section 4.3.  In particular, the 1 byte 'x' following 'kid
      context' (if any) encodes the size of the following field 'nonce',
      together with signaling bits that indicate the specific behavior
      to adopt during the KUDOS execution.

      Hereafter, a message is referred to as a "KUDOS (request/response)
      message", if and only if the second byte of flags is present and
      the 'd' bit is set to 1.  If that is not the case, the message is
      referred to as a "non KUDOS (request/response) message".

      The encoding of 'x' is as follows:

      -  The four least significant bits encode the 'nonce' size in
         bytes minus 1, namely 'm'.

      -  The fifth least significant bit is the "No Forward Secrecy" 'p'
         bit.  The sender peer indicates its wish to run KUDOS in FS
         mode or in no-FS mode, by setting the 'p' bit to 0 or 1,
         respectively.  This makes KUDOS possible to run also for peers
         that cannot support the FS mode.  At the same time, two peers
         MUST run KUDOS in FS mode if they are both capable to, as per
         Section 4.3.  The execution of KUDOS in no-FS mode is defined
         in Section 4.4.

      -  The sixth least significant bit is the "Preserve Observations"
         'b' bit.  The sender peer indicates its wish to preserve
         ongoing observations beyond the KUDOS execution or not, by
         setting the 'b' bit to 1 or 0, respectively.  The related
         processing is defined in Section 4.5.

      -  The seventh least significant bit is the 'z' bit.  The meaning
         of 'z' is as follows:

         o  z = 0: This is a "divergent" message, that is a KUDOS
            message protected with a temporary OSCORE Security Context
            and indicating that this peer is moving away from
            “equilibrium”. The peer is offering its own nonce in the
            message and waiting to receive the other peer’s nonce.

         o  z = 1: This is a "convergent" message, that is a KUDOS
            message protected with the newly established OSCORE Security
            Context and indicating that this is offering its own nonce
            in the message, has received the other peer’s nonce, and is
            going to wait for key confirmation (to return to
            equilibrium).

      -  The eight least significant bit is reserved for future use.
         This bit SHALL be set to zero when not in use.  According to
         this specification, if this bit is set to 1: i) if the message
         is a request, it is considered to be malformed and
         decompression fails as specified in item 2 of Section 8.2 of
         [RFC8613]; ii) if the message is a response, it is considered
         to be malformed and decompression fails as specified in item 2
         of Section 8.4 of [RFC8613] and the client SHALL discard the
         response as specified in item 8 of Section 8.4 of [RFC8613].

   'nonce'.

4.2.  Function for Security Context Update

   The updateCtx() function shown in Figure 2 takes as input the three
   parameters input1, input2, and CTX_IN.  In particular, input1 and
   input2 are built from the 'x' and 'nonce' fields transported in the
   OSCORE Option value of the exchanged KUDOS messages (see
   Section 4.1), while CTX_IN is the OSCORE Security Context to update.
   The function returns a new OSCORE Security Context CTX_OUT.

   As a first step, the updateCtx() function builds the two CBOR byte
   strings input1_cbor and input2_cbor, with value the input parameter
   input1 and input2, respectively.  Then, it builds X_N, as the byte
   concatenation of input1_cbor and input2_cbor.  In order for
   updateCtx() to be agnostic of the order the nonce values were
   exchanged, the input1_cbor and input2_cbor value are first sorted in
   lexicographical order before they are concatenated.  E.g. if
   input1_cbor comes before input2_cbor in lexicographical ordering,
   then X_N takes the value input1_cbor | input2_cbor and vice-versa.

   After that, the updateCtx() function derives the new values of the
   Master Secret and Master Salt for CTX_OUT.  In particular, the new
   Master Secret is derived through a KUDOS-Expand() step, which takes
   as input the Master Secret value from the Security Context CTX_IN,
   the literal string "key update", X_N, and the length of the Master
   Secret.  Instead, the new Master Salt takes N as value.

   The definition of KUDOS-Expand depends on the key derivation function
   used for OSCORE by the two peers, as specified in CTX_IN. either peer
   If the key derivation function is an HKDF Algorithm (see Section 3.1
   of [RFC8613]), then KUDOS-Expand is mapped to HKDF-Expand [RFC5869],
   as shown below.  Also, the hash algorithm is the same one used by the
   HKDF Algorithm specified in CTX_IN.

   KUDOS-Expand(CTX_IN.MasterSecret, ExpandLabel, key_length) =
      HKDF-Expand(CTX_IN.MasterSecret, ExpandLabel, key_length)

   If a future specification updates [RFC8613] by admitting different
   key derivation functions than HKDF Algorithms (e.g., KMAC as based on
   the SHAKE128 or SHAKE256 hash functions), that specification has to
   update also the present document in order to define the mapping
   between such key derivation functions and KUDOS-Expand.

   When an HKDF Algorithm is used, the derivation of new values follows
   the same approach used in TLS 1.3, which is also based on HKDF-Expand
   (see Section 7.1 of [RFC8446]) and used for computing new keying
   material in case of key update (see Section 4.6.3 of [RFC8446]).

   After that, the new Master Secret and Master Salt parameters are used
   to derive a new Security Context CTX_OUT as per Section 3.2 of
   [RFC8613].  Any other parameter required for the derivation takes the
   same value as in the Security Context CTX_IN.

   Note that the following holds for the newly derived CTX_OUT:

   *  In its Sender Context, the Sender Sequence Number is initialized
      to 0 as per Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613].

   *  If the peer that has derived CTX_OUT supports CoAP Observe
      [RFC7641], the Notification Number used for the replay protection
      of Observe notifications (see Section 7.4.1 of [RFC8613]) is left
      as not initialized.

   Finally, the updateCtx() function returns the newly derived Security
   Context CTX_OUT.

   Since the updateCtx() function also takes X as input, the derivation
   of CTX_OUT also considers as input the information from the 'x' field
   transported in the OSCORE Option value of the exchanged KUDOS
   messages.  In turn, this ensures that, if successfully completed, a
   KUDOS execution occurs as intended by the two peers.

   function updateCtx(input1, input2, CTX_IN):

     // Output values
     CTX_OUT       // The new Security Context
     MSECRET_NEW   // The new Master Secret
     MSALT_NEW     // The new Master Salt

     // Define the label for the key update
     Label = "key update"

     // Create CBOR byte strings from input1 and input2
     input1_cbor = create_cbor_bstr(input1)
     input2_cbor = create_cbor_bstr(input2)

     // Concatenate the CBOR-encoded input1 and input2
     // according to their lexicographic order
     X_N = input1_cbor.lexicographic.shorter(input1_cbor, input2_cbor) ?
           (input1_cbor | input2_cbor) : (input2_cbor | input1_cbor)

     // Determine the length in bytes of the current Master Secret
     oscore_key_length = length(CTX_IN.MasterSecret)

     // Create the new Master Secret using KUDOS-Expand-Label
     MSECRET_NEW = KUDOS_Expand_Label(CTX_IN.MasterSecret, Label,
                                      X_N, oscore_key_length)

     // Set the new Master Salt to X_N
     MSALT_NEW = X_N

     // Derive the new Security Context CTX_OUT, using
     // the new Master Secret, the new Master Salt,
     // and other parameters from CTX_IN
     CTX_OUT = derive_security_context(MSECRET_NEW, MSALT_NEW, CTX_IN)

     // Return the new Security Context
     return CTX_OUT


   function KUDOS_Expand_Label(master_secret, Label, X_N, key_length):

     struct {
         uint16 length = key_length;
         opaque label<7..255> = "oscore " + Label;
         opaque context<0..255> = X_N;
     } ExpandLabel;

     return KUDOS_Expand(master_secret, ExpandLabel, key_length)

4.3.  Key Update

   In this section, we define the KUDOS procedure that two peers use to
   update their OSCORE keying material.  Using KUDOS as described in
   this section will achieve forward secrecy for the new keying material
   produced by the execution of KUDOS, as long as the OSCORE keying
   material was also established with forward secrecy.  For peers unable
   to store information to persistent memory, Section 4.4 provides an
   alternative approach to perform key update without achieving forward
   secrecy.  This alternative ensures that also very constrained peers
   are able to use KUDOS, although without achieving forward secrecy.

   A peer can run KUDOS for active rekeying at any time, or for a
   variety of more compelling reasons.  These include the (approaching)
   expiration of the OSCORE Security Context, approaching limits for the
   key usage [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-limits], application policies,
   and imminent exhaustion of the OSCORE Sender Sequence Number space.

   The expiration time of an OSCORE Security Context and the key usage
   limits are hard limits.  Once reached them, a peer MUST stop using
   the keying material in the OSCORE Security Context for conventional
   communication with the other peer, and has to perform a rekeying
   before resuming secure communication.

   Before starting KUDOS, the two peers share the OSCORE Security
   Context CTX_OLD.  Once successfully completed the KUDOS execution,
   the two peers agree on a newly established OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_NEW that replaces CTX_OLD.  During the execution of KUDOS,
   temporary OSCORE Security Contexts, denoted CTX_TEMP, are dervied.
   CTX_OLD can be safely deleted upon receiving key confirmation from
   the other peer.

   In particular, CTX_OLD is the most recent OSCORE Security Context
   that a peer has with a given ID Context or without ID Context, before
   initiating the KUDOS procedure or upon having received and
   successfully verified the a divergent KUDOS message.  In turn,
   CTX_NEW is the most recent OSCORE Security Context that a peer has
   with a given ID Context or without ID Context, before sending a
   convergent KUDOS message or upon having received and successfully
   verified a convergent KUDOS message.

   The following specifically defines how KUDOS is run in its stateful
   FS mode achieving forward secrecy.  That is, in the OSCORE Option
   value of all the exchanged KUDOS messages, the "No Forward Secrecy"
   bit is set to 0.

   In order to run KUDOS in FS mode, both peers have to be able to write
   in non-volatile memory.  From the newly derived Security Context
   CTX_NEW, the peers MUST store to non-volatile memory the immutable
   parts of the OSCORE Security Context as specified in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC8613], with the possible exception of the Common IV, Sender Key,
   and Recipient Key that can be derived again when needed, as specified
   in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC8613].  If the peer is unable to write in
   non-volatile memory, the two peers have to run KUDOS in its stateless
   no-FS mode (see Section 4.4).

4.3.1.  Nonces and X Bytes

   When running KUDOS, each peer contributes by generating a nonce value
   N1 or N2, and providing it to the other peer.  The size of the nonces
   N1 and N2 is application specific, and the use of 8 byte nonce values
   is RECOMMENDED.  The nonces N1 and N2 MUST be random values, with the
   possible exception described later in Section 4.4.1.  Note that a
   good amount of randomness is important for the nonce generation.
   [RFC4086] provides guidance on the generation of random values.

   Furthermore, X1 and X2 are the value of the 'x' byte specified in the
   OSCORE Option of a KUDOS message X1 and N1 are the 'x' byte and nonce
   created by a peer, and X2 and N2 are the 'x' byte and nonce received
   from the other peer.  The X1 and X2 values are calculated by the
   sender peer based on: the length of nonce N1 and N2, specified in the
   'nonce' field of the OSCORE Option of a KUDOS message, respectively;
   as well as on the specific settings the peer wishes to run KUDOS
   with.  Note that a peer may not change the value of the 'x' byte
   during a KUDOS execution without restrictions.  Specifically, during
   the same KUDOS execution, all the KUDOS messages sent by a peer must
   have the same value in the bit 'b' for preserving ongoing
   observations.

   N1, N2, X1, and X2 are used by the peers to build the 'input1' and
   'input2' values provided to the updateCtx() function, in order to
   derive a new OSCORE Security Context.  As for any new OSCORE Security
   Context, the Sender Sequence Number and the Replay Window are re-
   initialized accordingly (see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC8613]).
   Specifically, the input to updateCtx() is built as follows, where |
   denotes byte concatenation:

   *  Protecting a divergent outgoing message: Input1 is X1 | N1, and
      input2 is 0x.  The output is CTX_TEMP.

   *  Unprotecting a divergent incoming message: Input1 is X2 | N2, and
      input2 is 0x.  The output is CTX_TEMP.

   *  (Un)protecting a convergent message: Input1 is X1 | N1, and input2
      is X2 | N2.  The output is CTX_NEW.

   A pair (X, nonce) offered by a peer is bound to CTX_OLD, and is
   reused as much as possible during the same KUDOS execution.  (X,
   nonce) is generated before invoking updateCtx(), in case a pair is
   not already associated with the CTX_OLD to use within updateCtx().
   The newly generated pair is associated with CTX_OLD before entering
   updateCtx().

4.3.2.  Handling of Messages

   If a KUDOS message is a CoAP request, then it can target two
   different types of resources at the recipient CoAP server:

   *  The well-known KUDOS resource at /.well-known/kudos, or an
      alternative KUDOS resource with resource type "core.kudos" (see
      Section 4.7.4 and Section 6.5).  In such a case, no application
      processing is expected at the CoAP server, and the plain CoAP
      request composed before OSCORE protection should not include an
      application payload.

   *  A non-KUDOS resource, i.e., an actual application resource that a
      CoAP request can target in order to trigger application processing
      at the CoAP server.  In such a case, the plain CoAP request
      composed before OSCORE protection may include an application
      payload, if admitted by the request method.

   In either case, the link to the target resource can have the "osc"
   target attribute to indicate that the resource is only accessible
   using OSCORE (see Section 9 of [RFC8613]).

   Similarly, any CoAP response can also be a KUDOS message.  If the
   corresponding CoAP request has targeted a KUDOS resource, then the
   plain CoAP response composed before OSCORE encryption should not
   include an application payload.  Otherwise, an application payload
   may be included.

4.3.3.  Avoiding In-Transit Requests During a Key Update

   Before sending a KUDOS message, the peer MUST ensure that it has no
   outstanding interactions with the other peer (see Section 4.7 of
   [RFC7252]), with the exception of ongoing observations [RFC7641].

   If any such outstanding interactions are found, the peer MUST NOT
   initiate or continue the KUDOS execution, before either: i) having
   all those outstanding interactions cleared; or ii) freeing up the
   Token values used with those outstanding interactions, with the
   exception of ongoing observations with the other peer.

   Later on, this prevents a non KUDOS response protected with the new
   Security Context CTX_NEW from cryptographically matching with both
   the corresponding request also protected with CTX_NEW and with an
   older request protected with CTX_OLD, in case the two requests were
   protected using the same OSCORE Partial IV.

   During an ongoing KUDOS execution, a peer MUST NOT send a non KUDOS
   message to the other peer, until having aborted or successfully
   completed the key update process on its side.  This could otherwise
   be possible, if the client is using a value of NSTART greater than 1
   (see Section 4.7 of [RFC7252]).

4.3.4.  KUDOS States

   A peer performs a KUDOS execution according to a state machine.
   Normally, the two peers are in "equilibrium", in the IDLE state of
   the KUDOS state machine.  During a KUDOS execution a peer can
   traverse three possible states: IDLE, BUSY, and PENDING.  A KUDOS
   execution starts upon entering the BUSY state from a state different
   from BUSY.  A peer succesfully completes a KUDOS execution by
   entering the IDLE state, at which point the peer has the OSCORE
   Security Context CTX_NEW and has achieved key confirmation.

   The decision about sending a KUDOS message is per the KUDOS state
   machine, and is based on the perception that this peer has about what
   the other peer has done.  That is, there is no need to take into
   account the details of one’s own local state.  The decision on
   processing a received KUDOS message is per the KUDOS state machine,
   and is based on what the recipient’s local status is.  Moving to a
   state due to a received message occurs only if the message passed
   decryption and verification with OSCORE.

   In its local status with the other peer, a peer tracks its current
   KUDOS state by means of the bits (c_tx, c_rx):

   *  (00) IDLE - The peer is not running KUDOS.

   *  BUSY - The peer is running KUDOS and:

      -  (01) has not offered a nonce, but has received the nonce from
         the other peer; or

      -  (10) has offered a nonce, but has not received the nonce from
         the other peer.

   *  (11) PENDING: the peer is running KUDOS, has offered its nonce,
      has received the nonce from the other peer, and is waiting for key
      confirmation.

4.3.5.  KUDOS State Machine

   Ane execution of KUDOS is driven by a state machine that the two
   peers independantly execute.  The current state determines correct
   actions for the peers to take, in terms of transitioning to other
   states and processing of messages.

4.3.5.1.  Startup

   At startup, the peer enter a *Pre-IDLE* state.

4.3.5.2.  Pre-IDLE

   1.  If the peer has any CTX_TEMP Security Contexts, delete them.

   2.  If the peer has both an old and a new OSCORE Security Contexts:
       a.  Delete the (X, nonce) pair associated with the old OSCORE
       Security Context.  b.  Delete the old OSCORE Security Context, or
       retain it only for processing of late incoming messages as
       allowed by retention policies.

   3.  Move to *IDLE*.

4.3.5.3.  IDLE

   *  @Receiving a convergent message while in *IDLE*

      1.  Ignore the message for the sake of KUDOS processing, but
          process it as a CoAP message.

      2.  Stay in *IDLE*

   *  @Receiving a divergent message while in *IDLE*

      1.  Move to *BUSY*.

   *  @Sending a divergent message while in *IDLE*

      1.  Move to *BUSY*.

4.3.5.4.  BUSY

   While in the *BUSY* state, the peer must not send non-KUDOS messages.

   *  @Entering *BUSY* due to receiving a divergent message

      1.  Send a convergent message.

      2.  Move to *PENDING*.

   *  @Entering *BUSY* due to sending a divergent message

      1.  Stay *BUSY*.

   *  @Receiving a divergent message while in *BUSY*

      1.  Send a convergent message.

      2.  Move to *PENDING*.

   *  @Receiving a convergent message while in *BUSY*

      1.  Achieve key confirmation

      2.  Move to *Pre-IDLE*.

   *  @Sending divergent message while in *BUSY*

      -  If CTX_TEMP is usable to protect the intended divergent
         message, send the message and then stay in *BUSY*.

      -  If CTX_TEMP is not usable to protect the intended divergent
         message, perform the following steps.  (E.g., this happens upon
         eventually exhausting the Sender Sequence Number values of
         CTX_TEMP)

         1.  Delete CTX_TEMP.

         2.  Delete the (X, nonce) pair associated with CTX_OLD, i.e.,
             whichever was used as CTX_IN to generate the CTX_TEMP
             deleted at the previous step.

         3.  Generate a new (X, nonce) pair and associate it with
             CTX_OLD.

         4.  Generate a new CTX_TEMP from CTX_OLD.

         5.  Send the intended divergent message protected with the
             CTX_TEMP generated at the previous step.

         6.  Stay in *BUSY*.

4.3.5.5.  Pending

   While in the *PENDING* state, the peer must not send non-KUDOS
   messages.

   *  @Receiving a convergent message while in *PENDING*

      1.  Move to *Pre-IDLE*.

   *  @Receiving a non-KUDOS message protected with the latest CTX_NEW
      while in *PENDING*

      1.  Achieve key confirmation

      2.  Move to *Pre-IDLE*.

   *  @Needing to send something (e.g., the application wants to send a
      request) while in *PENDING*

      1.  Send a convergent message, protected with the same, latest
          CTX_NEW.  (This is not possible anymore in case CTX_NEW
          becomes usable to protect outgoing messages, e.g., upon
          eventually exhausting the Sender Sequence Number values of
          CTX_NEW).

      2.  Stay in *PENDING*.

   *  @Receiving a divergent message while in *PENDING*

      -  If decryption and verification of the divergent message work
         using a CTX_TEMP derived from CTX_OLD:

         1.  Delete CTX_NEW.

         2.  Delete the pair (X, nonce) associated with CTX_OLD, i.e.,
             whichever was used as CTX_IN to generate the CTX_NEW
             deleted at the previous step.

         3.  Abort the ongoing KUDOS execution.

         4.  Move to *BUSY*.

      -  If decryption and verification of the divergent message work
         using a CTX_TEMP derived from CTX_NEW:

         1.  Delete the oldest CTX_TEMP

         2.  Delete CTX_OLD, i.e., whichever of the two was used as
             CTX_IN to generate the CTX_TEMP deleted at the previous
             step.

         3.  CTX_NEW becomes the oldest Security Context.  Next steps in
             this algorithm will refer to that Security Context as
             CTX_OLD.

         4.  Abort the ongoing KUDOS execution.

         5.  Move to *BUSY*.

4.3.6.  Handling of OSCORE Security Contexts

   A peer completes the key update process when it has achieved key
   confirmation and thus moved back to the IDLE state.

   The following properties hold for a execution of KUDOS.

   *  Both the peers use and preserve the same respective OSCORE Sender
      ID and Recipient ID.

   *  If CTX_OLD specifies an OSCORE ID Context, both peers use and
      preserve the same OSCORE ID Context.

   Once a peer has successfully derived the new OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_NEW, the following applies.

   *  The peer MUST use CTX_NEW to protect outgoing non KUDOS messages,
      and MUST NOT use the originally shared OSCORE Security Context
      CTX_OLD for protecting outgoing messages.

   *  The peer MUST delete the OSCORE Security Context CTX_DEL older
      than CTX_OLD such that, with reference to the immediately previous
      execution of KUDOS, both the following conditions hold:

      -  CTX_DEL was used for deriving the OSCORE Security Context
         CTX_TEMP used to protect the divergent KUDOS message; and

      -  CTX_OLD was used to protect the convergent KUDOS message.

   Note that if the procedure for updating IDs is run there may be a
   change of Sender/Recipient IDs between CTX_DEL and CTX_OLD.  The way
   to correctly keep the relation between the OSCORE Security Contexts
   is implementation specific.

   *  The peer MUST terminate all the ongoing observations [RFC7641]
      that it has with the other peer as protected with the old Security
      Context CTX_OLD, unless the two peers have explicitly agreed
      otherwise as defined in Section 4.5.

      More specifically, if either or both peers indicate the wish to
      cancel their observations, those will be all cancelled following a
      successful KUDOS execution.

      Note that, even though a peer had no real reason to update its
      OSCORE keying material, running KUDOS can be intentionally
      exploited as a more efficient way to terminate all the ongoing
      observations with the other peer, compared to sending one
      cancellation request per observation (see Section 3.6 of
      [RFC7641]).

4.4.  Key Update Admitting no Forward Secrecy

   The FS mode of the KUDOS procedure defined in Section 4.3 ensures
   forward secrecy of the OSCORE keying material.  However, it requires
   peers executing KUDOS to preserve their state (e.g., across a device
   reboot), by writing information such as data from the newly derived
   OSCORE Security Context CTX_NEW in non-volatile memory.

   This can be problematic for devices that cannot dynamically write
   information to non-volatile memory.  For example, some devices may
   support only a single writing in persistent memory when initial
   keying material is provided (e.g., at manufacturing or commissioning
   time), but no further writing after that.  Therefore, these devices
   cannot perform a stateful key update procedure, and thus are not
   capable to run KUDOS in FS mode to achieve forward secrecy.

   In order to address these limitations, KUDOS can be run in its
   stateless no-FS mode, as defined in the following.  This allows two
   peers to achieve the same results as when running KUDOS in FS mode
   (see Section 4.3), with the difference that no forward secrecy is
   achieved and no state information is required to be dynamically
   written in non-volatile memory.

   From a practical point of view, the two modes differ as to what exact
   OSCORE Master Secret and Master Salt are used as part of the OSCORE
   Security Context provided as input to the updateCtx() function (see
   Section 4.2).

   If either or both peers are not able to write in non-volatile memory
   the OSCORE Master Secret and OSCORE Master Salt from the newly
   derived Security Context CTX_NEW, then the two peers have to run
   KUDOS in no-FS mode.

4.4.1.  Handling and Use of Keying Material

   In the following, a device is denoted as "CAPABLE" if it is able to
   store information in non-volatile memory (e.g., on disk), beyond a
   one-time-only writing occurring at manufacturing or
   (re-)commissioning time.  If that is not the case, the device is
   denoted as "non-CAPABLE".

   The following terms are used to refer to OSCORE keying material.

   *  Bootstrap Master Secret and Bootstrap Master Salt.  If pre-
      provisioned during manufacturing or (re-)commissioning, these
      OSCORE Master Secret and Master Salt are initially stored on disk
      and are never going to be overwritten by the device.

   *  Latest Master Secret and Latest Master Salt.  These OSCORE Master
      Secret and Master Salt can be dynamically updated by the device.
      In case of reboot, they are lost unless they have been stored on
      disk.

   Note that:

   *  A peer running KUDOS can have none of the pairs above associated
      with another peer, only one, or both.

   *  A peer that has neither of the pairs above associated with another
      peer, cannot run KUDOS in any mode with that other peer.

   *  A peer that has only one of the pairs above associated with
      another peer can attempt to run KUDOS with that other peer, but
      the procedure might fail depending on the other peer's
      capabilities.  In particular:

      -  In order to run KUDOS in FS mode, a peer must be a CAPABLE
         device.  It follows that two peers have to both be CAPABLE
         devices in order to be able to run KUDOS in FS mode with one
         another.

      -  In order to run KUDOS in no-FS mode, a peer must have Bootstrap
         Master Secret and Bootstrap Master Salt available as stored on
         disk.

   *  A peer that is a non-CAPABLE device MUST support the no-FS mode.
      Note that an exception described in Section 4.4.3 exists for non-
      CAPABLE devices that lack Bootstrap Master Secret and Bootstrap
      Master Salt.

   *  A peer that is a CAPABLE device MUST support the FS mode and the
      no-FS mode.

   *  As an exception to the nonces being generated as random values
      (see Section 4.3.1), a peer that is a CAPABLE device MAY use a
      value obtained from a monotonically incremented counter as nonce.
      This has privacy implications, which are described in Section 5.
      In such a case, the peer MUST enforce measures to ensure freshness
      of the nonce values.  For example, the peer can use the same
      procedure described in Appendix B.1.1 of [RFC8613] for handling
      the OSCORE Sender Sequence Number values.  These measures require
      to regularly store the used counter values in non-volatile memory,
      which makes non-CAPABLE devices unable to safely use counter
      values as nonce values.

   As a general rule, once successfully generated a new OSCORE Security
   Context CTX (e.g., CTX is the CTX_NEW resulting from a KUDOS
   execution, or it has been established through the EDHOC protocol
   [RFC9528]), a peer considers the Master Secret and Master Salt of CTX
   as Latest Master Secret and Latest Master Salt.  After that:

   *  If the peer is a CAPABLE device, it MUST store Latest Master
      Secret and Latest Master Salt on disk, with the exception of
      possible temporary OSCORE Security Contexts used during a key
      update procedure, such as CTX_TEMP used during the KUDOS
      execution.  That is, the OSCORE Master Secret and Master Salt from
      such temporary Security Contexts are not stored on disk.

   *  The peer MUST store Latest Master Secret and Latest Master Salt in
      volatile memory, thus making them available to OSCORE message
      processing and possible key update procedures.

   Following a state loss (e.g., due to a reboot), a device MUST
   complete a successful KUDOS execution before performing an exchange
   of OSCORE-protected application data with another peer, unless:

   *  The device is CAPABLE and implements a functionality for safely
      reusing old keying material, such as that described in
      Appendix B.1 of [RFC8613]; or

   *  The device is exchanging OSCORE-protected data as part of a KUDOS
      execution in either of the KUDOS messages, as described in
      Section 4.3.2.  In such case, the plain CoAP request composed
      before OSCORE protection of the KUDOS message may include an
      application payload, if admitted by the request method.

4.4.2.  Selection of KUDOS Mode

   During a KUDOS execution, the two peers agree on whether to perform
   the key update procedure in FS mode or no-FS mode, by leveraging the
   "No Forward Secrecy" bit, 'p', in the 'x' byte of the OSCORE Option
   value of the KUDOS messages (see Section 4.1).  The 'p' bit
   practically determines what OSCORE Security Context to use as input
   to updateCtx() during the KUDOS execution, consistently with the
   indicated mode.

   *  If the 'p' bit is set to 0 (FS mode), the updateCtx() function
      used to derive CTX_TEMP or CTX_NEW considers as input CTX_OLD,
      meaning the current OSCORE Security Context shared with the other
      peer as is.  In particular, CTX_OLD includes Latest Master Secret
      as OSCORE Master Secret and Latest Master Salt as OSCORE Master
      Salt.

   *  If the 'p' bit is set to 1 (no-FS mode), the updateCtx() function
      used to derive CTX_TEMP or CTX_NEW considers as input
      CTX_BOOTSTRAP, that is it derives a new OSCORE Security Context
      using the Bootstrap Master Secret as OSCORE Master Secret and
      Bootstrap Master Salt as OSCORE Master Salt.  Thus, every
      execution of KUDOS in no-FS mode between these two peers considers
      the same pair (Master Secret, Master Salt) in the OSCORE Security
      Context CTX_BOOTSTRAP provided as input to the updateCtx()
      function, hence the impossibility to achieve forward secrecy.

      Note that this means that in the state machine described in
      sechtion {#ssec-state-machine}, any derived OSCORE Security
      Context created for protection or unprotection of a KUDOS message
      where the 'p' bit is set to 1 will take CTX_BOOTSTRAP as input to
      updateCtx().

   A peer determines to run KUDOS either in FS or no-FS mode with
   another peer as follows.

   *  If a peer A is a non-CAPABLE device, it MUST run KUDOS only in no-
      FS mode.  That is, when sending a KUDOS message, it MUST set to 1
      the 'p' bit of the 'x' byte in the OSCORE Option value.  Note
      that, if peer A lacks a Bootstrap Master Secret and Bootstrap
      Master Salt to use with the other peer B, it can still run KUDOS
      in FS mode according to what is defined in Section 4.4.3.

   *  If a peer A is a CAPABLE device, it SHOULD run KUDOS only in FS
      mode.  That is, when sending a KUDOS message, it SHOULD set to 0
      the 'p' bit of the 'x' byte in the OSCORE Option value.  An
      exception applies in the following cases.

      -  The peer A is running KUDOS with another peer B, which A has
         learned to be a non-CAPABLE device (and hence not able to run
         KUDOS in FS mode).

         Note that, if the peer A is a CAPABLE device, it is able to
         store such information about the other peer B on disk and it
         MUST do so.  From then on, the peer A will perform every
         execution of KUDOS with the peer B in no-FS mode, including
         after a possible reboot.

      -  The peer A is running KUDOS with another peer B without knowing
         its capabilities, and A receives a KUDOS message where the 'p'
         bit of the 'x' byte in the OSCORE Option value is set to 1.

   *  If a peer A is a CAPABLE device and has learned that another peer
      B is also a CAPABLE device (and hence able to run KUDOS in FS
      mode), then the peer A MUST NOT run KUDOS with the peer B in no-FS
      mode.  This also means that peer A MUST terminate the KUDOS
      execution if it receives a KUDOS message from the peer B where the
      'p' bit of the 'x' byte in the OSCORE Option value is set to 1.

      Note that, if the peer A is a CAPABLE device, it is able to store
      such information about the other peer B on disk and it MUST do so.
      This ensures that the peer A will perform every execution of KUDOS
      with the peer B in FS mode.  In turn, this prevents a possible
      downgrading attack, aimed at making A believe that B is a non-
      CAPABLE device, and thus to run KUDOS in no-FS mode although the
      FS mode can actually be used by both peers.

4.4.3.  Non-CAPABLE Devices Operating in FS Mode

   Devices may not be pre-provisioned with Bootstrap material, for
   instance due to storage limitations of persistent memory or to fulfil
   particular use cases.  Bootstrap material means specifically the
   Bootstrap Master Secret and Bootstrap Master Salt, and Latest
   material means the Latest Master Secret and Latest Master Salt as
   defined in Section 4.4.1.  Normally, a non-CAPABLE device always uses
   KUDOS in no-FS mode.  An exception is possible, if the Bootstrap
   material is dynamically installed at that device through an in-band
   process between that device and the peer device.  In such a case, it
   is possible for this device to run KUDOS in FS mode with the peer
   device.

   Note that, under the assumption that peer A does not have any
   Bootstrap material with another peer B, peer A cannot use the no-FS
   mode with peer B, even though peer A is a non-CAPABLE device.  Thus,
   allowing peer A to use KUDOS in FS mode ensures that peer A can
   perform a key update using KUDOS at all.

   The following describes how a non-CAPABLE device in the situation
   outlined above, namely peer A, runs KUDOS in FS mode with another
   peer B:

   *  Peer A is not provisioned with Bootstrap material associated with
      peer B at the time of manufacturing or commissioning.

   *  Peer A establishes OSCORE keying material associated with peer B
      through an in-band procedure run with peer B.  Then, peer A
      considers that keying material as the Latest material with peer B,
      and stores it only in volatile memory.

      -  An example of such an in-band procedure is the EDHOC and OSCORE
         profile of ACE [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], according
         to which the two peers run the EDHOC protocol [RFC9528] for
         establishing an OSCORE Security Context to associate with
         access rights.  This in-band procedure may occur multiple times
         over the device's lifetime.

   *  Peer A runs KUDOS in FS mode with peer B, thereby achieving
      forward secrecy for subsequent key update epochs, as long as the
      OSCORE keying material was originally established with forward
      secrecy.  Peer A stores each newly derived Security Context in
      volatile memory.

   As long as peer A does not reboot, executions of KUDOS rely on the
   Latest material stored in volatile memory.  If peer A reboots, no
   OSCORE keying material associated with the peer B will be retained,
   as peer A is non-CAPABLE and therefore stores it only in volatile
   memory.  Consequently, peer A must first establish new OSCORE keying
   material to use as Latest material with peer B, before running KUDOS
   again with peer B.  This can be accomplished by running again the in-
   band procedure mentioned above.

4.5.  Preserving Observations Across Key Updates

   As defined in Section 4.3, once a peer has completed the KUDOS
   execution and successfully derived the new OSCORE Security Context
   CTX_NEW, that peer normally terminates all the ongoing observations
   it has with the other peer [RFC7641], as protected with the old
   OSCORE Security Context CTX_OLD.

   This section describes a method that the two peers can use to safely
   preserve the ongoing observations that they have with one another,
   beyond the completion of a KUDOS execution.  In particular, this
   method ensures that an Observe notification can never successfully
   cryptographically match against the Observe requests of two different
   observations, e.g., against an Observe request protected with CTX_OLD
   and an Observe request protected with CTX_NEW.

   The actual preservation of ongoing observations has to be agreed by
   the two peers at each execution of KUDOS that they run with one
   another, as defined in Section 4.5.1.  If, at the end of a KUDOS
   execution, the two peers have not agreed on that, they MUST terminate
   the ongoing observations that they have with one another, just as
   defined in Section 4.3.6.

4.5.1.  Management of Observations

   As per Section 3.1 of [RFC7641], a client can register its interest
   in observing a resource at a server, by sending a registration
   request including the Observe Option with value 0.

   If the server registers the observation as ongoing, the server sends
   back a successful response also including the Observe Option, hence
   confirming that an entry has been successfully added for that client.

   If the client receives back the successful response above from the
   server, then the client also registers the observation as ongoing.

   In case the client can ever consider to preserve ongoing observations
   beyond a key update as defined below, then the client MUST NOT simply
   forget about an ongoing observation if not interested in it anymore.
   Instead, the client MUST send an explicit cancellation request to the
   server, i.e., a request including the Observe Option with value 1
   (see Section 3.6 of [RFC7641]).  After sending this cancellation
   request, if the client does not receive back a response confirming
   that the observation has been terminated, the client MUST NOT
   consider the observation terminated.  The client MAY try again to
   terminate the observation by sending a new cancellation request.

   In case a peer A performs a KUDOS execution with another peer B, and
   A has ongoing observations with B that it is interested to preserve
   beyond the key update, then A can explicitly indicate its interest to
   do so.  To this end, the peer A sets to 1 the bit "Preserve
   Observations", 'b', in the 'x' byte of the OSCORE Option value (see
   Section 4.1), in the KUDOS message it sends to the other peer B.

   If a peer acting receives a KUDOS message with the bit 'b' set to 0,
   then the peer MUST set to 0 the bit 'b' in the KUDOS message it sends
   as follow-up, regardless of its wish to preserve ongoing observations
   with the other peer.

   If a peer acting has sent a KUDOS message with the bit 'b' set to 0,
   the peer MUST ignore the bit 'b' in the follow-up KUDOS message that
   it receives from the other peer.

   Note that during the same KUDOS execution, all the KUDOS messages
   sent by a peer must have the same value in the bit 'b' for preserving
   ongoing observations.

   After successfully completing the KUDOS execution (i.e., after having
   successfully derived the new OSCORE Security Context CTX_NEW), both
   peers have expressed their interest in preserving their common
   ongoing observations if and only if the bit 'b' was set to 1 in both
   the exchanged KUDOS messages.  In such a case, each peer X performs
   the following actions.

   1.  The peer X considers all the still ongoing observations that it
       has with the other peer, such that X acts as client in those
       observations.  If there are no such observations, the peer X
       takes no further actions.  Otherwise, it moves to step 2.

   2.  The peer X considers all the OSCORE Partial IV values used in the
       Observe registration request associated with any of the still
       ongoing observations determined at step 1.

   3.  The peer X determines the value PIV* as the highest OSCORE
       Partial IV value among those considered at step 2.

   4.  In the Sender Context of the OSCORE Security Context shared with
       the other peer, the peer X sets its own Sender Sequence Number to
       (PIV* + 1), rather than to 0.

   As a result, each peer X will "jump" beyond the OSCORE Partial IV
   (PIV) values that are occupied and in use for ongoing observations
   with the other peer where X acts as client.

   Note that, each time it runs KUDOS, a peer must determine if it
   wishes to preserve ongoing observations with the other peer or not,
   before sending its KUDOS message.

   To this end, the peer should also assess the new value that PIV*
   would take after a successful completion of KUDOS, in case ongoing
   observations with the other peer are going to be preserved.  If the
   peer considers such a new value of PIV* to be too close to or equal
   to the maximum possible value admitted for the OSCORE Partial IV,
   then the peer may choose to run KUDOS with no intention to preserve
   its ongoing observations with the other peer, in order to "start
   over" from a fresh, entirely unused PIV space.

   Application policies can further influence whether attempting to
   preserve observations beyond a key update is appropriate or not.

4.6.  Retention Policies

   Applications MAY define policies that allow a peer to temporarily
   keep the old Security Context CTX_OLD beyond having established the
   new Security Context CTX_NEW and having achieved key confirmation,
   rather than simply overwriting CTX_OLD with CTX_NEW.  This allows the
   peer to decrypt late, still on-the-fly incoming messages protected
   with CTX_OLD.

   When enforcing such policies, the following applies.

   *  Outgoing non KUDOS messages MUST be protected by using only
      CTX_NEW.

   *  Incoming non KUDOS messages MUST first be attempted to decrypt by
      using CTX_NEW.  If decryption fails, a second attempt can use
      CTX_OLD.

   *  KUDOS messages MUST NOT be protected or unprotected by using
      CTX_OLD.

   *  When an amount of time defined by the policy has elapsed since the
      establishment of CTX_NEW, the peer deletes CTX_OLD.

   A peer MUST NOT retain CTX_OLD beyond the establishment of CTX_NEW
   and the achievement of key confirmation, if any of the following
   conditions holds: CTX_OLD is expired; limits set for safe key usage
   have been reached [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-limits], for the
   Recipient Key of the Recipient Context of CTX_OLD.

4.7.  Discussion

   KUDOS is intended to deprecate and replace the procedure defined in
   Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613], as fundamentally achieving the same goal,
   while displaying a number of improvements and advantages.

   In particular, it is especially convenient for the handling of
   failure events concerning the JRC node in 6TiSCH networks (see
   Section 2).  That is, among its intrinsic advantages compared to the
   procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613], KUDOS preserves the
   same ID Context value, when establishing a new OSCORE Security
   Context.

   Since the JRC uses ID Context values as identifiers of network nodes,
   namely "pledge identifiers", the above implies that the JRC does not
   have to perform anymore a mapping between a new, different ID Context
   value and a certain pledge identifier (see Section 8.3.3 of
   [RFC9031]).  It follows that pledge identifiers can remain constant
   once assigned, and thus ID Context values used as pledge identifiers
   can be employed in the long-term as originally intended.

4.7.1.  KUDOS Interleaved with Other Message Exchanges

   During a KUDOS execution, a peer that is a CoAP Client must be ready
   to receive CoAP responses that are not KUDOS messages and that are
   protected with a different OSCORE Security Context than the one that
   was used to protect the corresponding request.

   This can happen, for instance, when a CoAP client sends a request
   and, shortly after that, it executes KUDOS.  In such a case, the CoAP
   request is protected with CTX_OLD, while the CoAP response from the
   server is protected with CTX_NEW.  Another case is when incoming
   responses are Observe notifications protected with CTX_NEW, while the
   corresponding request from the CoAP client that started the
   observation was protected with CTX_OLD.

   Another case is when running KUDOS, if the client uses NSTART > 1 and
   one of its requests triggers a KUDOS execution, i.e., the server
   replies with a divergent KUDOS message.  The other requests would be
   latest served by the server after KUDOS has been completed.

4.7.2.  Communication Overhead

   Each of the two KUDOS messages results in communication overhead.
   This is determined by the following, additional information conveyed
   in the OSCORE Option (see Section 4.1).

   *  The second byte of the OSCORE Option value.

   *  The byte 'x' of the OSCORE Option value.

   *  The nonce conveyed in the 'nonce' field of the OSCORE Option.  Its
      size ranges from 1 to 16 bytes as indicated in the 'x' byte, and
      is typically of 8 bytes.

   *  The 'Partial IV' parameter of the OSCORE Option value, in a CoAP
      response message that is a KUDOS message.

      This takes into account the fact that OSCORE-protected CoAP
      response messages normally do not include the 'Partial IV'
      parameter, but they have to when they are KUDOS messages (see
      Section 3).

   *  The first byte of the OSCORE Option value (i.e., the first OSCORE
      flag byte), in a CoAP response message that is a KUDOS message.

      This takes into account the fact that OSCORE-protected CoAP
      response messages normally convey an OSCORE Option that only
      consists of the all zero (0x00) flag byte.  In turn, this results
      in the OSCORE Option being encoded as with empty value (see
      Section 2 of [RFC8613].

   *  The possible presence of the 1-byte Option Length (extended) field
      in the OSCORE Option (see Section 3.1 of [RFC7252]).  This is the
      case where the length of the OSCORE Option value is between 13 and
      255 bytes (see Section 2 of [RFC8613]).

   The results shown in figure {table-overhead-forward} are the minimum,
   typical, and maximum communication overhead introduced by KUDOS, when
   considering a nonce with size 1, 8, and 16 bytes.  All the indicated
   values are in bytes.  The overhead is calculated based on a scenario
   of a CoAP request serving as the divergent message, followed by a
   CoAP response server as the convergent message.

   In particular, the shown results build on the following assumptions.

   *  Both messages of the same KUDOS execution use nonces of the same
      size, and do not include the 'kid context' parameter in the OSCORE
      Option value.

   *  When included in the OSCORE Option value, the 'Partial IV'
      parameter has size 1 byte.

   *  CoAP request messages include the 'kid' parameter with size 1 byte
      in the OSCORE Option value.

   *  CoAP response messages do not include the 'kid' parameter in the
      OSCORE Option value.

      +============+=======================+===============+=======+
      | Nonce size | Request KUDOS message | Response      | Total |
      |            |                       | KUDOS message |       |

      +------------+-----------------------+---------------+-------+

            Table 1: Communication overhead (request-response)

4.7.3.  Resource Type core.kudos

   The "core.kudos" resource type registered in Section 6.5 is defined
   to ensure a means for clients to send KUDOS requests without
   incurring any side effects.  Specifically, a resource of this type
   does not pertain to any real application, which ensures that no
   application-level actions are triggered as a result of the KUDOS
   request.  This allows clients to issue KUDOS requests when they do
   not include any actionable application payload in the plain CoAP
   request composed before OSCORE protection, or when no application-
   layer processing is intended to occur on the server.

4.7.4.  Well-Known KUDOS Resource

   According to this specification, KUDOS is transferred in POST
   requests and 2.04 (Changed) responses.  If a client wishes to execute
   the KUDOS procedure without triggering any application processing on
   the server, then a request sent as a KUDOS message can target a KUDOS
   resource with resource type "core.kudos" (see Section 4.7.3), e.g.,
   at the Uri-Path "/.well-known/kudos" (see Section 6.4).  An
   alternative KUDOS resource can be discovered, e.g., by using a
   resource directory [RFC9176], by using the resource type "core.kudos"
   as filter criterion.

4.7.5.  Rekeying when Using SCHC with OSCORE

   In the interest of rekeying, the following points must be taken into
   account when using the Static Context Header Compression and
   fragmentation (SCHC) framework [RFC8724] for compressing CoAP
   messages protected with OSCORE, as defined in [RFC8824].

   Compression of the OSCORE Partial IV has implications for the
   frequency of rekeying.  That is, if the Partial IV is compressed, the
   communicating peers must perform rekeying more often, as the
   available Partial IV space becomes smaller due to the compression.
   For instance, if only 3 bits of the Partial IV are sent, then the
   maximum PIV before having to rekey is only 2^3 - 1 = 7.

   Furthermore, any time the SCHC context Rules are updated on an OSCORE
   endpoint, that endpoint must perform a rekeying (see Section 9 of
   [RFC8824]).

   That is, the use of SCHC plays a role in triggering KUDOS executions
   and in affecting their cadence.  Hence, the used SCHC Rules and their
   update policies should ensure that the KUDOS executions occurring as
   their side effect do not significantly impair the gain from message
   compression.

4.8.  Signaling KUDOS support in EDHOC

   The EDHOC protocol defines the transport of additional External
   Authorization Data (EAD) within an optional EAD field of the EDHOC
   messages (see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528]).  An EAD field is composed of
   one or multiple EAD items, each of which specifies an identifying
   'ead_label' encoded as a CBOR integer, and an optional 'ead_value'
   encoded as a CBOR bstr.

   This document defines a new EDHOC EAD item KUDOS_EAD and registers
   its 'ead_label' in Section 6.3.  By including this EAD item in an
   outgoing EDHOC message, a sender peer can indicate whether it
   supports KUDOS and in which modes, as well as query the other peer
   about its support.  Note that peers do not have to use this EDHOC EAD
   item to be able to run KUDOS with each other, irrespective of the
   modes they support.  A KUDOS peer MUST only use the EDHOC EAD item
   KUDOS_EAD as non-critical.  That is, when included in an EDHOC
   message, its 'ead_label' MUST be used with positive sign.  The
   possible values of the 'ead_value' are as follows:

     +======+==========+=============================================+
     | Name | Value    | Description                                 |
     +======+==========+=============================================+
     | ASK  | h''      | Used only in EDHOC message_1.  It asks the  |
     |      | (0x40)   | recipient peer to specify in EDHOC          |
     |      |          | message_2 whether it supports KUDOS.        |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     | NONE | h'00'    | Used only in EDHOC message_2 and message_3. |
     |      | (0x4100) | It specifies that the sender peer does not  |
     |      |          | support KUDOS.                              |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     | FULL | h'01'    | Used only in EDHOC message_2 and message_3. |
     |      | (0x4101) | It specifies that the sender peer supports  |
     |      |          | KUDOS in FS mode and no-FS mode.            |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PART | h'02'    | Used only in EDHOC message_2 and message_3. |
     |      | (0x4102) | It specifies that the sender peer supports  |
     |      |          | KUDOS in no-FS mode only.                   |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

              Table 2: Values for the EDHOC EAD item KUDOS_EAD

   When the KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_1 with
   'ead_value' ASK, a recipient peer that supports the KUDOS_EAD item
   MUST specify whether it supports KUDOS in EDHOC message_2.

   When the KUDOS_EAD item is not included in EDHOC message_1 with
   'ead_value' ASK, a recipient peer that supports the KUDOS_EAD item
   MAY still specify whether it supports KUDOS in EDHOC message_2.

   When the KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_2 with
   'ead_value' FULL or PART, a recipient peer that supports the
   KUDOS_EAD item SHOULD specify whether it supports KUDOS in EDHOC
   message_3.  An exception applies in case, based on application
   policies or other context information, the recipient peer that
   receives EDHOC message_2 already knows that the sender peer is
   supposed to have such knowledge.

   When the KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_2 with
   'ead_value' NONE, a recipient peer that supports the KUDOS_EAD item
   MUST NOT specify whether it supports KUDOS in EDHOC message_3.

   In the following cases, the recipient peer silently ignores the
   KUDOS_EAD item specified in the received EDHOC message, and does not
   include a KUDOS_EAD item in the next EDHOC message it sends (if any).

   *  The recipient peer does not support the KUDOS_EAD item.

   *  The KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_1 with 'ead_value'
      different than ASK

   *  The KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_2 or message_3
      with 'ead_value' ASK.

   *  The KUDOS_EAD item is included in EDHOC message_4.

   That is, by specifying 'ead_value' ASK in EDHOC message_1, a peer A
   can indicate to the other peer B that it wishes to know if B supports
   KUDOS and in what mode(s).  In the following EDHOC message_2, B
   indicates whether it supports KUDOS and in what mode(s), by
   specifying either NONE, FULL, or PART as 'ead_value'.  Specifying the
   'ead_value' FULL or PART in EDHOC message_2 also asks A to indicate
   whether it supports KUDOS in EDHOC message_3.

   To further illustrate the functionality, two examples are presented
   below as EDHOC executions where only the new KUDOS_EAD item is shown
   when present, and assuming that no other EAD items are used by the
   two peers.

        EDHOC                                                 EDHOC
        Initiator                                         Responder
        |                                                         |
        |                EAD_1: (TBD_LABEL, ASK)                  |
        +-------------------------------------------------------->|
        |                        message_1                        |
        |                                                         |
        |                EAD_2: (TBD_LABEL, FULL)                 |
        |<--------------------------------------------------------+
        |                        message_2                        |
        |                                                         |
        |                EAD_3: (TBD_LABEL, FULL)                 |
        +-------------------------------------------------------->|
        |                        message_3                        |
        |                                                         |

   In the example above, the Initiator asks the EDHOC Responder about
   its support for KUDOS ('ead_value' = ASK).  In EDHOC message_2, the
   Responder indicates that it supports both the FS and no-FS mode of
   KUDOS ('ead_value' = FULL).  Finally, in EDHOC message_3, the
   Initiator indicates that it also supports both the FS and no-FS mode
   of KUDOS ('ead_value' = FULL).  After the EDHOC execution has
   successfully finished, both peers are aware that they both support
   KUDOS, in the FS and no-FS modes.

        EDHOC                                                 EDHOC
        Initiator                                         Responder
        |                                                         |
        |                EAD_1: (TBD_LABEL, ASK)                  |
        +-------------------------------------------------------->|
        |                        message_1                        |
        |                                                         |
        |                EAD_2: (TBD_LABEL, NONE)                 |
        |<--------------------------------------------------------+
        |                        message_2                        |
        |                                                         |
        +-------------------------------------------------------->|
        |                        message_3                        |
        |                                                         |

   In this second example, the Initiator asks the EDHOC Responder about
   its support for KUDOS ('ead_value' = ASK).  In EDHOC message_2, the
   Responder indicates that it does not support KUDOS at all
   ('ead_value' = NONE).  Finally, in EDHOC message_3, the Initiator
   does not include the KUDOS_EAD item, since it already knows that
   using KUDOS with the other peer will not be possible.  After the
   EDHOC execution has successfully finished, the Initiator is aware
   that the Responder does not support KUDOS, which the two peers are
   not going to use with each other.

5.  Security Considerations

   Depending on the specific key update procedure used to establish a
   new OSCORE Security Context, the related security considerations also
   apply.

   As mentioned in Section 4.3.1, it is RECOMMENDED that the size for
   nonces N1 and N2 is 8 bytes.  The application needs to set the size
   of each nonce such that the probability of its value being repeated
   is negligible.  Note that the probability of collision of nonce
   values is heightened by the birthday paradox.  However, considering a
   nonce size of 8 bytes there will be a collision on average after
   approximately 2^32 instances of Response #1 messages.

   Overall, the size of the nonces N1 and N2 should be set such that the
   security level is harmonized with other components of the deployment.
   Considering the constraints of embedded implementations, there might
   be a need for allowing N1 and N2 values that are smaller in size.
   This is acceptable, provided that safety, reliability, and robustness
   within the system can still be assured.  Although using nonces that
   are smaller in size means that there will be a collision on average
   after fewer KUDOS messages have been sent, this should not pose
   significant problems even for a constrained server operating at a
   capacity of one request per second.

   The nonces exchanged in the KUDOS messages are sent in the clear, so
   using random nonces is preferable for maintaining privacy.  If
   instead a counter value is used, this can leak some information about
   the peers.  Specifically, using counters will reveal the frequency of
   rekeying procedures performed.

   As discussed in [Symmetric-Security], key update methods built on
   symmetric key exchange have weaker security properties compared to
   methods built on ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In fact,
   while the two approaches can co-exist, rekeying with symmetric key
   exchange is not intended as a substitute for ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange.  Peers should periodically perform a key update based
   on ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange (e.g., by running the EDHOC
   protocol [RFC9528]).  The cadence of such periodic key updates should
   be determined based on how much the two peers and their network
   environment are constrained, as well as on the maximum amount of time
   and of exchanged data that are acceptable between two consecutive key
   updates.
